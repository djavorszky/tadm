# The Algorithm Design Manual code snippets

While reading the book [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena-ebook-dp-B00B8139Z8/dp/B00B8139Z8/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) by [Steven S. Skiena](https://twitter.com/stevenskiena), I'm using this repository to write up the algorithms, in Rust.
